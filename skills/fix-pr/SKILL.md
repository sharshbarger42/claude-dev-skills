# Fix PR Skill

Address all review comments on a Gitea pull request: fetch comments, classify by source, implement fixes, and push to the PR branch.

**Input:** PR reference as the skill argument. Accepted formats:
- Shorthand: `food-automation#34`
- Owner/repo: `super-werewolves/food-automation#34`
- Full URL: `https://git.home.superwerewolves.ninja/super-werewolves/food-automation/pulls/34`

## Step 1: Parse the PR reference

Extract `owner`, `repo`, and PR `index` from the argument.

### Repo resolution

!`cat $HOME/gitea-repos/development-skills/lib/resolve-repo.md`

## Step 2: Fetch PR metadata

Use `mcp__gitea__get_pull_request_by_index` with the parsed `owner`, `repo`, and `index` to get:
- Title, body
- Head branch (this is the branch we'll check out and push to)
- Base branch
- Default branch (`base.repo.default_branch`)

If the PR is not found, report the error and stop.

## Step 3: Fetch all comments

Gather every comment on the PR from three sources:

1. **Review comments (inline):** Use `mcp__gitea__list_pull_request_reviews` to get all reviews. For each review, use `mcp__gitea__list_pull_request_review_comments` to get the inline comments (these have `path`, `position`, and `body`).

2. **Top-level PR comments:** Use `mcp__gitea__get_issue_comments_by_index` to get non-review comments on the PR thread.

Collect all comments into a single list with these fields per comment:
- `id` (comment ID — needed for resolving later)
- `review_id` (the parent review ID, if inline comment)
- `review_state` (the parent review's state: `APPROVED`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, `COMMENT`)
- `path` (file path, if inline comment; empty for top-level)
- `position` (line position, if inline)
- `body` (comment text)
- `user.login` (who posted it)
- `source` (see Step 4)

## Step 4: Classify comments

Split comments by `user.login`:

- **User comments** — any comment where `user.login` is NOT `code-review-agent`. These are directives and MUST be addressed. Top priority.
- **Review agent comments** — comments where `user.login` IS `code-review-agent`. These are suggestions and SHOULD be addressed.

**Threading:** Group comments that share the same `path` + `position`. When a user replies to a review-agent comment on the same path/position, the user's reply modifies or overrides the agent's suggestion — use the user's intent.

For each actionable comment, extract:
- `path` — file to change
- `position` — where in the file
- `body` — what to do
- `source` — `user` or `review-agent`
- `action` — what change is needed (fix code, create issue, etc.)

## Step 5: Read repo AGENTS.md

Use `mcp__gitea__get_file_content` to fetch `AGENTS.md` from the repo's default branch (from Step 2 metadata — do NOT hardcode `master` or `main`).

If AGENTS.md doesn't exist, note that no repo-specific coding standards were found and proceed without it.

## Step 6: Present summary and confirm

Show the user a summary:
- Count: **X user comments**, **Y review-agent comments**
- Brief description of each comment and the proposed fix
- Any comments that request issue creation (e.g., "create a ticket for X")
- Any comments you plan to skip and why

Use `AskUserQuestion` to get confirmation. **Do NOT start coding until the user confirms.**

## Step 7: Set up workspace

Run these commands using the Bash tool:

1. `cd` to the local repo path from the shorthand table
2. Verify the directory exists — if not, tell the user to clone the repo first and stop
3. `git fetch origin`
4. `git checkout {head_branch} && git pull origin {head_branch}`
5. Verify clean working tree (`git status --porcelain`) — if dirty, warn the user and ask how to proceed

No new branch creation — we push directly to the existing PR branch.

## Step 8: Implement the changes

Read the relevant files and address each comment:

1. **User comments first** (top priority) — implement exactly what the user asked for
2. **Review-agent comments second** — implement the suggested improvements
3. **Issue creation** — for comments that say "create a ticket for X" or similar, use `mcp__gitea__create_issue` to create the issue in the appropriate repo

Follow the repo's AGENTS.md coding standards when making changes.

## Step 9: Commit and push

1. Stage changed files individually (`git add <file1> <file2> ...` — NOT `git add -A` or `git add .`)
2. Commit with message format: `fix(#{pr_index}): address PR review — {brief summary}`
   - **IMPORTANT:** Per AGENTS.md Rule 3 — NO Claude/AI/co-authored-by references in commit messages
3. Push to the head branch: `git push origin {head_branch}`

## Step 10: Resolve addressed comments

After pushing, mark addressed comments as resolved on the PR:

1. **Reply to each inline comment** that was addressed: use `mcp__gitea__create_issue_comment` to post a brief top-level comment summarizing which comments were fixed and the commit SHA. Format:

   ```
   Addressed review comments in {commit_sha}:
   - {path}:{position} — {brief description of fix}
   - {path}:{position} — {brief description of fix}
   ```

2. **Dismiss `REQUEST_CHANGES` reviews** that are now fully addressed: use `mcp__gitea__dismiss_pull_request_review` with the `review_id` from Step 3 and message `"All requested changes addressed in {commit_sha}"`. Only dismiss reviews where **every** inline comment from that review was addressed.

   Do NOT dismiss reviews where some comments were skipped — those still need attention.

3. **Re-request review** (optional): if the review was from `code-review-agent` and changes were significant, note in the report that the user may want to re-run `/review-pr` to verify.

## Step 11: Report

Tell the user:
1. **Summary of changes** — what was modified and why
2. **Comments addressed** — list each comment that was fixed
3. **Comments skipped** — any comments not addressed, with reasons
4. **Reviews dismissed** — list any `REQUEST_CHANGES` reviews that were dismissed
5. **Issues created** — links to any new Gitea issues
6. **Files changed** — list of modified files
